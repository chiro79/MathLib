MathLib version 1.1, 13 April 1999, by Rick Huebner (rhuebner@radiks.net)
The latest version, source code, bug reports, etc. are available at the
MathLib Information web page: http://www.radiks.net/~rhuebner/mathlib.html


Please note that several of the filenames used in this library are more
than 8 characters long.  You should use WinZip or another zip unpacker
that properly preserves long file names to unpack this archive.


Files included in this archive:

MathLDoc.htm: HTML documentation for MathLib; use your web browser to read
MathLib.prc:  MathLib shared library, ready to use
MathLib.h:    Header file to allow your program to access MathLib functions
MathLib.c:    MathLib function wrappers for more convenient use
MathLib.mcp:  MetroWerks CodeWarrior project file for rebuilding MathLib
All other .c and .h files: Complete source code for MathLib


If you just want to get the latest version of MathLib to load into your
Pilot, all you need is MathLib.prc.  Install it like any regular Pilot
application and it'll be available to any program that needs it.

If you want to call MathLib functions from your own program, all you need
are MathLib.prc, MathLib.h, MathLib.c, and MathLDoc.htm.  Read through the
doc file and you should be up and running in minutes; it's very easy to use.
